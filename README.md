## About this app (For onboarding)
 
### UI 

Bootstrap

### Plugins

1. To Generate sitemap: .https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/plugin-sitemap
2. To generate robot.txt: https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-robots-txt
3. Comment section: https://utteranc.es/ 
4. Contact Form: Netlify
5. Subscription Form: Mailchimp 

### Notes
1. For contact Form to work you must enable Form function in Netlify and remember to make forms redirect to willogy's email (all in Form function in Netlify)
2. Utterances' code is already in Post.vue, but haven't edited to the right path of willogy, repo haven't install Utterance like instructions
3. To get Mailchimp api's key in details, this is the video to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjk25N7WFkI&t=1790s
But in short, just sign up, go to audience => Sign Up Form => Embedded Forms, just choose any, and you can find our own api's key 
in their auto-generated codes, copy and paste it into our template form, which I placed it in Default.vue.
